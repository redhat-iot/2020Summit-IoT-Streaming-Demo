# 2020Summit-IoT-Streaming-Demo
Live Streaming and Analytics Demo for 2020 Virtual Summit 

It is split up into three major pieces 

- `IoT Camera Simulator` -> Pulls video from any youtube livestream and pushes it to the Kafka http bridge 

- `Analytics Service` -> Gets live video data from kafka in the form of a Cloud Event, Sends the data to tensorflow-serving for inference, overlays the inference on the video, and uploads live video segments to ceph object storage 

- `Video Serving Service` -> Pulls the live video stream segments from ceph, builds the HLS playlist file, serves the inferenced video to the user with a static flask based webapp

The overall system diagram and main components are shown below
